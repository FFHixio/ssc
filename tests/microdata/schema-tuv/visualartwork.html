                A <span itemprop="artform">painting</span> also known as
                <span>The Treason of Images</span> or
                <span itemprop="alternateName">The Treachery of Images</span>.
            </p>

                    The painting shows a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted,
                    <q lang="fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</q>, French for
                    "This is not a pipe."
                </p>
                <p>
                    His statement is taken to mean that the painting itself is not a pipe.
                    The painting is merely an image of a pipe. Hence, the description,
                    "this is not a pipe."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the image shown above is neither a pipe nor even a painting,
                    but rather a digital photograph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed
                    by paralanguage. Compare with Korzybski's <q>The word is not the thing</q>
                    and <q>The map is not the territory</q>.

                is an <span itemprop="artform">installation</span> by the British artist Tracey Emin.

                    <cite>My Bed</cite> was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in
                    <time datetime="1998">1999</time> as one
                    of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her
                    bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media
                    attention. Although it did not win the prize, its notoriety has
                    persisted.

                The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the
                fact that the <span itemprop="artMedium">bedsheets</span> were stained
                with bodily secretions and the floor had items from the artist's room
                (such as <span itemprop="artMedium">condoms</span>,
                <span itemprop="artMedium">a pair of knickers</span> with menstrual
                period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects,
                including a <span itemprop="artMedium">pair of slippers</span>). The
                <span itemprop="artMedium">bed</span> was presented in the state that
                Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for
                several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship
                difficulties.

                    was eighty years old, are counted among Picasso’s most important works
                    in linocut, a technique that he explored in the late 1950s and early
                    1960s. The progressive proofs show the step by step sequence by which
                    Picasso created his linocut images showing the development of the
                    image into its final form.
