terms &amp; conditions of sale</h1>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<ol>
<li>These terms and conditions govern the sale and purchase of products through our website.
<li>You will be asked to give your express agreement to these terms and conditions before you place an order on our website.
<li>This document does not affect any statutory rights you may have as a consumer.
</ol>

<br>

<li>Interpretation
<ol>
<li>In these terms and conditions:
<ol><li>&ldquo;we&rdquo; means corrupt&nbsp;press; and
<li>&ldquo;you&rdquo; means our customer or prospective customer,</ol>
and &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; should be construed accordingly.
</ol>

<br>

<li>Order process
<ol>
<li>The advertising of products on our website constitutes an &lsquo;invitation to treat&rsquo; rather than a contractual offer.
<li>No contract will come into force between you and us unless and until we accept your order in accordance with the procedure set out in this Section 3.
<li>To enter into a contract through our website to purchase products from us, the following steps must be taken:
<ol><li>you must add the products you wish to purchase to your shopping cart, and then proceed to the checkout;
<li>you will be transferred to our payment service provider&rsquo;s website, and our payment service provider will handle your payment;
<li>we will then send you an initial acknowledgement;
<li>and once we have checked whether we are able to meet your order, we will either send you an order confirmation (at which point your order will become a binding contract) or we will confirm by email that we are unable to meet your order.</ol>
<li>You will have the opportunity to identify and correct input errors prior to making your order by cancelling and restarting.
</ol>

<br>

<li>Products
<ol>
<li>The following types of products are or may be available on our website from time to time: books, CDs, posters and prints.
<li>We may periodically change the products available on our website, and we do not undertake to continue to supply any particular product or type of product.
</ol>

<br>

<li>Prices
<ol>
<li>The prices of our products are quoted on our website.
<li>We will from time to time change the product prices quoted on our website, but this will not affect contracts that have previously come into force.
<li>In addition to the price of the products, you will have to pay a delivery charge, which will be notified to you before the contract of sale comes into force.
</ol>

<br>

<li>Payments
<ol>
<li>You must, during the checkout process, pay the prices of the products you order.
<li>Payments must be made by any of the permitted methods specified on our website from time to time.
<li>If you fail to pay to us any amount due under these terms and conditions in accordance with the provisions of these terms and conditions, then we may withhold the products ordered and/or by written notice to you at any time cancel the contract of sale for the products.
<li>If you make an unjustified credit card, debit card or other charge&ndash;back then you will be liable to pay us, within 7 days following the date of our written request:
<ol><li> an amount equal to the amount of the charge-back;
<li>all third party expenses incurred by us in relation to the charge&ndash;back (including charges made by our or your bank or payment processor or card issuer);
<li>an administration fee of &euro;25.00; and
<li>all our reasonable costs, losses and expenses incurred in recovering the amounts referred to in this Section 6.4 (including without limitation legal fees and debt collection fees),
<li>and for the avoidance of doubt, if you fail to recognise or fail to remember the source of an entry on your card statement or other financial statement, and make a charge&ndash;back as a result, this will constitute an unjustified charge&ndash;back for the purposes of this Section 6.4.
</ol></ol>

<br>

<li>Deliveries
<ol>
<li>Our policies and procedures relating to the delivery of products are set out in our <a href="delivery.shtml">delivery policy</a> document.
</ol>

<br>

<li>Distance selling: right of cancellation
<ol>
<li>This section applies if and only if you contract with us as a consumer.
<li>Consumers have a right to cancel any distance contract to purchase a product or products from us at any time within the period:
<ol><li>beginning upon the conclusion of the contract of sale under these terms and conditions; and
<li>ending after a period of 7 working days beginning with the day after the day on which you receive the product or products,
subject to the limitations set out in this section.</ol>
<li>You will not have any right to cancel a contract as described in this section insofar as the contract relates to:
<ol><li> the supply of any products which constitute audio or video recordings or computer software which have been unsealed by you;
<li>the supply of products the price of which is dependent upon fluctuations in financial markets which we cannot control;
<li>the supply of goods made to your specifications or clearly personalised.</ol>
<li>In order to cancel a contract on the basis described in this section, you must give to us written notice of cancellation, which may be sent to the business address or email address specified on our website.
<li>If you cancel a contract on the basis described in this section, you must return the product or products to us.
<li>If you cancel a contract on the basis described in this section, you will receive a full refund of the amount you paid, including the cost of sending the product or products to you; however, you will be responsible for paying the cost of returning the product or products to us.
<li>If you cancel a contract on the basis described in this section and you do not return the product or products to us, we may recover the product or products and charge you for the costs we incur in doing so; similarly, if you return the product or products at our expense, we may pass that expense on to you.
<li>We will usually refund money using the same method used to make the payment.
<li>We will process the refund due to you as a result of a cancellation on the basis described in this section as soon as possible and, in any case, within the period of 30 days following the day we receive your valid notice of cancellation.
</ol>

<br>

<li>Warranties and representations
<ol>
<li>You warrant and represent to us that:
<ol><li>you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts;
<li>you have full authority, power and capacity to agree to these terms and conditions;
<li>all the information that you provide to us in connection with your order is true, accurate, complete and non&ndash;misleading; and
<li>you will be able to take delivery of the products in accordance with these terms and conditions and our delivery policy.</ol>
<li>We warrant to you that:
<ol><li> we have the right to sell the products that you buy;

<li>the products you buy will be of satisfactory quality.</ol>

</ol>

<br>

<li>Breach of product warranty
<ol>
<li>If you believe that products you have purchased from us breach any of the warranties set out in Section 9.2, please contact us to discuss the issue and arrangements for the return of the products.
<li>If products you purchase from us do not conform with the warranties set out in Section 9.2, then you will be entitled to a refund of all amounts paid in respect of those products. Alternatively and subject to availability, we may agree to supply you with replacement products, in which case we will pay the cost of delivering those replacement products to you. In either case we will reimburse you for your reasonable expenses incurred in returning the products to us.
<li>If you return a product in contravention of these terms and conditions, and you do not have any other legal right to a refund or exchange in respect of that product:
<ol><li> we will not refund the purchase price or exchange the product;
<li>we may retain the returned product until you pay to us such additional amount as we may charge for re&ndash;delivery of the returned product; and
<li>if we do not receive payment of such additional amount within 14 days of issuing a request for payment, we may destroy or otherwise dispose of the returned product in our sole discretion without any liability to you.
</ol></ol>

<li>The limitations and exclusions of liability set out in this Section 11 and elsewhere in these terms and conditions:
<ol><li> are subject to Section 11.1; and
<li>govern all liabilities arising under these terms and conditions or relating to the subject matter of these terms and conditions, including liabilities arising in contract, in tort (including negligence) and for breach of statutory duty.</ol>

<li>We may cancel a contract to supply a product or products made under these terms and conditions by written notice to you if we are prevented from fulfilling that contract by any event beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation any unavailability of raw materials, components or products, or any power failure, industrial dispute affecting any third party, governmental regulations, fire, flood, disaster, riot, terrorist attack or war.
</ol>

<br>
